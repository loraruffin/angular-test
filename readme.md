Hello!

Here's an API call that returns a list of places with photos

[http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos](http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos)

To get photos for a place add the place ID to the API call like so

[http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos/282039223](http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos/282039223)

(If neither of the links work for you, use the provided sample files.)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a single page application using AngularJS meeting the following requirements:

* The home page should display the list of the cities by name. The data should come from the first API call.
* Clicking a city name should display that city's photo thumbnails and captions. That data should come from the second API call. 
* A user should be able to use a URL to navigate to the city list view or to the photo list view.
